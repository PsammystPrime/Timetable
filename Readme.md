# A simple HTML timetable.

This is a timetable of a languages teacher.
On Friday she has a new class teaching Dutch all day, 
but she also teaches German for a few periods on Tuesday and Thursdays.
She wants to highlight the columns containing the days she is teaching German and Dutch.

A simple task to test my understanding on basics of HTML tables. Feel free to use it.
